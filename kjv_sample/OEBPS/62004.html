<h3>The Spirit of God and the Spirit of Antichrist</h3>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="chapter-number">4</span> <a class="verse-number" href="62004_toc.html">1</a>&#160;Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004002" href="62004_toc.html">2</a>&#160;Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: <a class="verse-number" id="_62004003" href="62004_toc.html">3</a>&#160;And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004004" href="62004_toc.html">4</a>&#160;Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004005" href="62004_toc.html">5</a>&#160;They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004006" href="62004_toc.html">6</a>&#160;We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. </p>

<h3>God is Love</h3>

<p><a class="verse-number" id="_62004007" href="62004_toc.html">7</a>&#160;Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004008" href="62004_toc.html">8</a>&#160;He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004009" href="62004_toc.html">9</a>&#160;In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004010" href="62004_toc.html">10</a>&#160;Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004011" href="62004_toc.html">11</a>&#160;Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004012" href="62004_toc.html">12</a>&#160;No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. </p>

<p><a class="verse-number" id="_62004013" href="62004_toc.html">13</a>&#160;Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004014" href="62004_toc.html">14</a>&#160;And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004015" href="62004_toc.html">15</a>&#160;Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004016" href="62004_toc.html">16</a>&#160;And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. </p> 

<p>God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004017" href="62004_toc.html">17</a>&#160;Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004018" href="62004_toc.html">18</a>&#160;There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004019" href="62004_toc.html">19</a>&#160;We love him, because he first loved us. <a class="verse-number" id="_62004020" href="62004_toc.html">20</a>&#160;If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? <a class="verse-number" id="_62004021" href="62004_toc.html">21</a>&#160;And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also. </p>
