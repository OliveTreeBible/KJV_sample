<h3>Salutation</h3>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="chapter-number">1</span> <a class="verse-number" href="63001_toc.html">1</a>&#160;The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth; <a class="verse-number" id="_63001002" href="63001_toc.html">2</a>&#160;For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever. <a class="verse-number" id="_63001003" href="63001_toc.html">3</a>&#160;Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. </p>

<h3>Truth and Love</h3>

<p><a class="verse-number" id="_63001004" href="63001_toc.html">4</a>&#160;I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. <a class="verse-number" id="_63001005" href="63001_toc.html">5</a>&#160;And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. <a class="verse-number" id="_63001006" href="63001_toc.html">6</a>&#160;And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it. <a class="verse-number" id="_63001007" href="63001_toc.html">7</a>&#160;For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. <a class="verse-number" id="_63001008" href="63001_toc.html">8</a>&#160;Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. <a class="verse-number" id="_63001009" href="63001_toc.html">9</a>&#160;Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. <a class="verse-number" id="_63001010" href="63001_toc.html">10</a>&#160;If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: <a class="verse-number" id="_63001011" href="63001_toc.html">11</a>&#160;For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</p>

<h3>Final Greetings</h3>

<p><a class="verse-number" id="_63001012" href="63001_toc.html">12</a>&#160;Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full. <a class="verse-number" id="_63001013" href="63001_toc.html">13</a>&#160;The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen. </p>
