<h3>Salutation</h3>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="chapter-number">1</span> <a class="verse-number" href="64001_toc.html">1</a>&#160;<a class="strongs-number" epub:type="noteref" href="strongs_dictionary.html#g3588">The</a> <a class="strongs-number" epub:type="noteref" href="strongs_dictionary.html#g4245">elder</a> unto <a class="strongs-number" epub:type="noteref" href="strongs_dictionary.html#g3588">the</a> <a class="strongs-number" epub:type="noteref" href="strongs_dictionary.html#g0027">wellbeloved</a> <a class="strongs-number" epub:type="noteref" href="strongs_dictionary.html#g1050">Gaius</a>, <a class="strongs-number" epub:type="noteref" href="strongs_dictionary.html#g3739">whom</a> <a class="strongs-number" epub:type="noteref" href="strongs_dictionary.html#g1473">I</a> <a class="strongs-number" epub:type="noteref" href="strongs_dictionary.html#g0025">love</a> <a class="strongs-number" epub:type="noteref" href="strongs_dictionary.html#g1722">in</a> the <a class="strongs-number" epub:type="noteref" href="strongs_dictionary.html#g0225">truth.</a> <a class="verse-number" id="_64001002" href="64001_toc.html">2</a>&#160;Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. <a class="verse-number" id="_64001003" href="64001_toc.html">3</a>&#160;For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. <a class="verse-number" id="_64001004" href="64001_toc.html">4</a>&#160;I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. </p>

<h3>Cooperation and Opposition</h3>

<p><a class="verse-number" id="_64001005" href="64001_toc.html">5</a>&#160;Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; <a class="verse-number" id="_64001006" href="64001_toc.html">6</a>&#160;Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well: <a class="verse-number" id="_64001007" href="64001_toc.html">7</a>&#160;Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles. <a class="verse-number" id="_64001008" href="64001_toc.html">8</a>&#160;We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth. <a class="verse-number" id="_64001009" href="64001_toc.html">9</a>&#160;I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not. <a class="verse-number" id="_64001010" href="64001_toc.html">10</a>&#160;Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church. <a class="verse-number" id="_64001011" href="64001_toc.html">11</a>&#160;Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God. <a class="verse-number" id="_64001012" href="64001_toc.html">12</a>&#160;Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true. </p>

<h3>Final Greetings</h3>

<p><a class="verse-number" id="_64001013" href="64001_toc.html">13</a>&#160;I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee: <a class="verse-number" id="_64001014" href="64001_toc.html">14</a>&#160;But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name. </p>
