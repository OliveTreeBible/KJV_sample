<h2 id="_62003001"><a href="62000_toc.html">The First Epistle General of John</a> </h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="chapter-number">3</span> <a class="verse-number" href="62003_toc.html">1</a>&#160;Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003002" href="62003_toc.html">2</a>&#160;Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003003" href="62003_toc.html">3</a>&#160;And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. </p>

<p><a class="verse-number" id="_62003004" href="62003_toc.html">4</a>&#160;Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003005" href="62003_toc.html">5</a>&#160;And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003006" href="62003_toc.html">6</a>&#160;Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003007" href="62003_toc.html">7</a>&#160;Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003008" href="62003_toc.html">8</a>&#160;He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003009" href="62003_toc.html">9</a>&#160;Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003010" href="62003_toc.html">10</a>&#160;In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. </p>

<h3>Love One Another</h3>

<p><a class="verse-number" id="_62003011" href="62003_toc.html">11</a>&#160;For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003012" href="62003_toc.html">12</a>&#160;Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003013" href="62003_toc.html">13</a>&#160;Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003014" href="62003_toc.html">14</a>&#160;We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003015" href="62003_toc.html">15</a>&#160;Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003016" href="62003_toc.html">16</a>&#160;Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003017" href="62003_toc.html">17</a>&#160;But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? <a class="verse-number" id="_62003018" href="62003_toc.html">18</a>&#160;My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</p>

<h3>Confidence Before God</h3>

<p><a class="verse-number" id="_62003019" href="62003_toc.html">19</a>&#160;And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003020" href="62003_toc.html">20</a>&#160;For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003021" href="62003_toc.html">21</a>&#160;Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003022" href="62003_toc.html">22</a>&#160;And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003023" href="62003_toc.html">23</a>&#160;And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. <a class="verse-number" id="_62003024" href="62003_toc.html">24</a>&#160;And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us. </p>
